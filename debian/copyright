no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent 
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such 
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, 
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative 
Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object 
form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this 
License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed 
the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, 
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display 
generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not 
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works 
that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying 
the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may 
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, 
or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under 
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of 
the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law 
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to 
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any 
and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised 
of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance 
of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your 
own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, 
and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License: LGPL-2.1+
 The upstream license clarifies pretty well that the sources of pulseaudio are
 LGPL (please see LGPL license grant below), but that some parts will be
 effectively GPL since they rely on GPL libraries, quoting the upstream
 LICENSE:

    """All PulseAudio source files are licensed under the GNU Lesser General
    Public License. (see file LGPL for details)

    However, the server side links to the GPL-only library 'libsamplerate'
    which practically downgrades the license of the server part to GPL (see
    file GPL for details), exercising section 3 of the LGPL.

    Hence you should treat the client library ('libpulse') of PulseAudio as
    being LGPL licensed and the server part ('libpulsecore') as being GPL
    licensed. Since the PulseAudio daemon and the modules link to
    'libpulsecore' they are of course also GPL licensed.

    -- Lennart Poettering, April 20th, 2006."""
