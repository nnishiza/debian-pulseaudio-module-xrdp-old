	* : Modified the JACK sink heavily:
	  * Made the sink realtime-safe.
	  * To achieve the previous item, internal buffering was be added.
	  New module
	  argument: buffersize.
	  * Removed the user's need to set the JACK transport to playing
	  state before he
	  could hear anything from PulseAudio.

2006-11-06 10:14  ossman

	* : Handle when threaded mainloop is freed before it is started.

2006-09-26 23:50  lennart

	* : rework memory block management to be thread-safe and mostly
	  lock-free.
	  
	  pa_memblock is now an opaque structure. Access to its fields is
	  now done
	  through various accessor functions in a thread-safe manner.
	  
	  pa_memblock_acquire() and pa_memblock_release() are now used to
	  access the
	  attached audio data. Why? To allow safe manipulation of the
	  memory pointer
	  maintained by the memory block. Internally _acquire() and
	  _release() maintain a
	  reference counter. Please do not confuse this reference counter
	  whith the one
	  maintained by pa_memblock_ref()/_unref()!
	  
	  As a side effect this patch removes all direct usages of AO_t and
	  replaces it
	  with pa_atomic_xxx based code.
	  
	  This stuff needs some serious testing love. Especially if threads
	  are actively
	  used.

2006-09-26 23:42  lennart

	* : upgrade refcnt.h to make use of our new pa_atomic_xxx() API

2006-09-26 23:41  lennart

	* : add asynchronous inter-thread notification API

2006-09-20 19:02  lennart

	* : enable module-hal-detect in the default configuration file only
	  if HAL support is enabled (closes #30)

2006-09-20 19:01  lennart

	* : rename default realtime group from "realtime" to "pulse-rt",
	  since it is pulseaudio specific. you may still pass
	  --with-realtime-group=realtime to configure to get the old
	  behaviour

2006-09-19 07:54  ossman

	* : Revert r1398 as it broke the srcdir != builddir patch. New fix
	  that doesn't
	  use the $(mkdir_p) define as it isn't present on many systems.

2006-09-19 07:49  ossman

	* : No need to create these dirs as they're part of the source
	  tree.

2006-09-14 16:00  ossman

	* : update Makefile

2006-09-09 23:55  lennart

	* : make pa_mutex_new() and pa_cond_new() succeed in all cases.
	  Similar behaviour to pa_xmalloc().

2006-09-09 23:54  lennart

	* : add pa_once testing code

2006-09-09 23:54  lennart

	* : rework pa_once once again, because the once function needs to
	  have terminated before pa_once returns, regardless whether the
	  local call executes it or another thread does.
	  
	  With the previous code it might happen that an long-running
	  initializing in a once function is not terminated yet when
	  another thread thinks it already is.

2006-09-09 22:59  lennart

	* : update for newer APIs: replace direct usage of libatomic_ops by
	  usage of our own atomic.h; remove pa_once implementation; always
	  use our pa_once implementation instead of the POSIX version

2006-09-09 21:05  lennart

	* : implement a simple lock-free free list

2006-09-08 15:43  lennart

	* : add a tiny wrapper around libatomic_ops: pa_atomic_int_t and
	  pa_atomit_ptr_t.
	  
	  Reasoning:
	  
	  This wrapper fixes a few API issues I found with atomic_ops:
	  
	  * AO_t is an int, which can be written to with "=".
	  pa_tomic_int_t however is
	  a struct which due to type-safety enforces proper access with
	  pa_atomic_xx(). (Inspired by the way the Linux kernel handles
	  this)
	  
	  * AO_load()'s parameter is lacking a "const"
	  
	  * Explicitly choosing the proper memory barrier for each call is
	  very
	  difficult and especially hard to debug because most CPUs support
	  only two
	  different barrier types which the eight types defined by
	  atomic_ops are
	  mapped to. Most other software (i.e. glib, Linux kernel) which
	  provides
	  atomic variable access usually do a full barrier in all cases and
	  so should
	  we. Eventually we might choose to add additional memory barrier
	  calls, in
	  which case we can add special versions of the current function
	  with special
	  suffixes.
	  
	  * The function names are unnecesarily long
	  
	  * Atomic pointer accesses are only supported with manual casts.
	  
	  The new pa_atomic_xxx interface borrows heavily from the GLib and
	  Linux kernel
	  atomicity API, though it is different from both of them.
	  
	  In addition this abstract API makes it easy to port PA to
	  different atomicty
	  APIs, if libatomic_ops should ever become out-of-fashion or if
	  the system OS
	  supports atomic primitives anyway.

2006-09-07 20:17  lennart

	* : don't maintain a list of allocated mempool slots, we don't use
	  it anyway

2006-09-07 19:08  lennart

2006-08-31 16:39  ossman

	* : Make sure libatomic_ops.a isn't included in win32 builds as
	  libtool doesn't
	  like static libs in dlls. Everything is in the headers anyway, so
	  we do not
	  need it.

	  independent.

	  passing NULL as
	  sink/source name sink/source we should pass NULL to
	  pa_sink_input_new()/pa_source_output_new() as too. This allows
	  hooks to change the sink/source device only if it is left
	  unspecified by the client

2006-08-18 23:45  lennart

	* : enable SHM support on the client side only if both the client
	  and the server run as the same user and the server supports it

2006-08-18 23:44  lennart

	* : activate SHM support on the server side only when new client
	  supports it and when client and server have the same UID.

2006-08-18 23:43  lennart

	* : one s/0/NULL/

2006-08-18 23:42  lennart

	* : remove export/import objects when SHM is disable for a
	  pa_pstream object

2006-08-18 23:40  lennart

	  pa_logXXX("

2006-08-18 21:26  lennart

	* : rework logging subsystem, to implicitly include __FILE__ in
	  pa_log() calls. In addition we now record the line numbers and
	  function names of pa_log calls. However, those are only shown If
	  $PULSE_LOG_META is set.

2006-08-18 19:56  lennart

	* : update tests for new memory manager

2006-08-18 19:55  lennart

	* : Rework memory management to allow shared memory data transfer.
	  The central idea
	  is to allocate all audio memory blocks from a per-process memory
	  pool which is
	  available as read-only SHM segment to other local processes.
	  Then, instead of
	  writing the actual audio data to the socket just write references
	  to this
	  shared memory pool.
	  
	  To work optimally all memory blocks should now be of type
	  PA_MEMBLOCK_POOL or
	  PA_MEMBLOCK_POOL_EXTERNAL. The function pa_memblock_new() now
	  generates memory
	  blocks of this type by default.

2006-08-18 19:46  lennart

	* : add abstracted shared memory API

2006-08-18 19:42  lennart

	* : cleanup idxset.[ch] a little: define proper types for the

	* : make PA_LLIST_HEAD_INIT thread safe

2006-08-15 18:15  lennart

	* : minor optimization

2006-08-13 19:55  lennart

	  nature of the protocol

2006-08-13 17:30  lennart

	* : remove pa_sink_input::variable_rate field since it has been
	  folded into pa_sink_input::flags

	* : hide hook-list-test

2006-08-13 16:21  lennart

	  sink input from a hook instead of an asyncronous subscription
	  event.

2006-08-13 16:19  lennart

	* : allow hooking into the process of creating playback streams. To
	  implement this I modified the pa_sink_input_new() signature to
	  take a pa_sink_input_new_data structure instead of direct
	  arguments.

2006-08-13 16:14  lennart

	* : fix bad printf()

2006-08-13 16:13  lennart

	  devices, print a nice warning and take what we can get instead

2006-08-12 15:08  lennart

	* : there's no need to queue subscription events if noone is
	  listening, hence don't do it!

2006-08-12 13:18  lennart

	* : * only load an OSS driver for the first device of a sound card,

	* : allow setting the null sink description by a module parameter

2006-08-11 23:58  lennart

	* : don't set the sink/source descriptions manually, use the new
	  functions pa_{sink,source}_set_description() instead

2006-08-11 23:31  lennart

	* : comment which values in
	  pa_{sink,source,sink_input,source_output} structures may be NULL

2006-08-11 17:53  lennart

	* : * introduce new functions pa_sink_set_description() and

	  * allow sinks without monitor sources attached

2006-08-11 17:15  lennart

2006-08-11 16:29  lennart

	* : remove OSS specific code from module-hal-detect if HAVE_OSS is
	  not set. Same for ALSA

2006-08-11 15:08  lennart

	* : ALSA: handle write()/read() errors properly by unloading the
	  driver module. This should fix problems when removing USB audio
	  device while pulseaudio is running.

2006-08-11 15:06  lennart

	* : change order of the ALSA event dispatch code to make sure that
	  the code survives if the event dispatcher frees the ALSA client

2006-08-11 15:05  lennart

	* : Implement pa_source_input_move_to() for moving record streams
	  between sources

2006-08-03 22:29  lennart

	* : - don't call pa_sink_notify in pa_sink_input_new() because the
	  virtual methods are not yet initialized at this time
	  - some minor cleanups

2006-08-01 21:04  lennart

	* : bump API and protocol version. Return PA_ERR_NOTSUPPORTED if
	  pa_context_move_sink_input_by_*()is called for servers that don't
	  support it

2006-07-31 21:55  lennart

2006-07-31 21:54  lennart

	* : add new native protocol function for moving sink inputs between
	  sinks

2006-07-31 21:54  lennart

	  outputs

2006-07-31 21:53  lennart

	* : deal properly with recursive module unloading

2006-07-31 21:53  lennart

2006-07-29 17:20  lennart

	* : don't hit an assetr if there are operations outstanding when
	  the pa_context is destroyed

2006-07-29 15:34  lennart

	  the comments wrong but the code right, not the other way round!
	  ;-))

2006-07-29 15:07  lennart

	* : add new CLI function "move-sink-input" as wrapper around
	  pa_sink_input_move_to()

2006-07-29 15:06  lennart

	* : * implement "hot" moving of playback streams between sinks
	  (pa_sink_input_move_to()).
	  * optimize the adjusting of the volume in pa_sink_input_peek() a
	  little

2006-07-29 15:04  lennart

	* : free the memblockq if we decide not to play it

2006-07-29 15:03  lennart

2006-07-29 15:02  lennart

	* : fix calculation of pa_usec_to_bytes, to make sure that it never
	  returns fractions of a frame size

2006-07-29 15:02  lennart

	* : handle EOF correctly if it is read before the stream was
	  created

2006-07-28 23:29  lennart

	* : for the playing field of pa_timing_info use
	  pa_sink_input::state == PA_SINK_INPUT_RUNNING. This means that
	  this variable will now refer to the current state and not to the
	  expected future state, which is probably more what clients
	  expect.

2006-07-28 23:27  lennart

	* : fold the seperate variable pa_sink_input::playing into
	  pa_sink_input::state as state PA_SINK_INPUT_DRAINED. The
	  following mappings hold:
	  
	  old PA_SINK_RUNNING + playing set = new PA_SINK_RUNNING
	  old PA_SINK_RUNNING + playing not set = new PA_SINK_DRAINED

2006-07-28 22:52  lennart

	* : introduce pa_play_memblockq() which creates a playback stream
	  and passes the data from the memblockq to it. after that is done,

	* : update todo

2006-07-27 18:35  lennart

	* : load module-gconf in default install

2006-07-27 18:02  lennart

	* : introduce three virtual sink/source names: @DEFAULT_SINK@,
	  @DEFAULT_SOURCE@, @DEFAULT_MONITOR@. Especially the latter is
	  useful for connecting to the monitor source of the default sink.

2006-07-27 16:51  lennart

	* : if possible do not unload already loaded modules when the gconf
	  settings change. instead try to reuse already loaded modules as
	  much as possible

2006-07-27 16:50  lennart

	* : because gconf doesn't provide real transactions we emulate our
	  own with a "locked" gconf key

2006-07-27 16:49  lennart

	* : remove superfluous code

2006-07-26 22:39  lennart

	* : remove two superfluous lines

	* : mainloop fixes: when disabling time events when dispatching
	  them, make sure to adjust the cache time event and enabled time
	  event counters

2006-07-26 18:28  lennart

	* : add some protection that the gconf helper process will be
	  killed when the daemon process dies. make sure the gconf helper
	  process doesn't keep open file descriptors belonging to the
	  daemon; if gconf helper path

2006-07-26 17:46  lennart

	* : add missing configure.ac checks for module-gconf

2006-07-26 17:36  lennart

	* : add new module "module-gconf" which reads configuration
	  information from gconf. this will be used in my upcoming paconf
	  module

2006-07-25 20:51  lennart

	* : add new command line option --no-cpu-limit. This is useful when
	  running PulseAudio in valgrind's massif or callgrind tools

2006-07-25 20:39  lennart

	* : Results of profiling PulseAudio with valgrind's callgrind
	  module: rework the default event loop implementation to use
	  PA_LLIST_xxx instead of pa_idxset; don't generate weakeup events
	  if we aren't in STATE_POLLING; minimize dispatching of io events;
	  cache next time event instead of traversing the list of time
	  events on every event loop iteration; other optimizations

2006-07-25 20:10  lennart

	* : split a few asserts

2006-07-25 20:10  lennart

	* : split a few assert()s

2006-07-25 20:09  lennart

2006-07-24 17:48  lennart

	* : bump version and sonames

2006-07-23 22:36  lennart

	* : add massif target to Makefile

2006-07-23 22:35  lennart

	* : as a result of memory profiling with valgrind/massif: decrease
	  default hash table size from 1024 to 127. the hashtables are
	  sparsely filled most of the time, so there is no point in
	  allocating to much memory by default.

2006-07-23 19:23  lennart

	* : fix horribly broken glib timeout event handling

2006-07-21 21:19  ossman

	* : Use proper @libdir@ in pc.in files to handle x86_64 machines.

2006-07-21 19:59  lennart

	* : raise the default value for RLIMIT_NOFILE to 200 since 25 is
	  apparently too small if every single GNOME apps thinks it needs
	  to create its own server connection!

2006-07-20 23:21  ossman

	* : Get ACL:s to work on Win32.

2006-07-20 23:12  lennart

2006-07-20 23:04  lennart

2006-07-20 22:46  lennart

	* : add missing #ifdef HAVE_CREDS (thanks, Flameeyes)

2006-07-20 22:44  lennart

	* : some more FreeBSD compat from Flameeyes

2006-07-20 21:48  lennart

	* : bump release and sonames

2006-07-20 21:28  lennart

	* : remove configurable client access group, since can never work
	  on Linux anway, since SCM_CREDENTAILS doesn't allow sending
	  supplementary GIDs

2006-07-20 18:43  lennart

	* : update todo

2006-07-20 18:43  lennart

	* : implement "auth-ip-acl=" in the native and esound protocols

2006-07-20 16:56  lennart

	* : add IP address ACL subsystem

2006-07-20 13:28  ossman

	* : Fix incorrect call to nonexistant pa_log_warning().

2006-07-20 13:24  ossman

	* : Only warn when running as root and not --system.

2006-07-20 13:24  ossman

	* : Centralise check if we're running as root.

2006-07-20 13:19  ossman

	* : Move check for SUID into the caps functions.

2006-07-20 13:16  ossman

2006-07-20 01:25  lennart

	* : add support to set resource limits for the daemon and set some
	  of them to some sane values

2006-07-20 00:52  lennart

	* : undo r1111 in some way: include sys/socket.h and sys/un.h but
	  wrap it in #ifdef
	  HAVE_xxx_H. This should be safe because config.h should be the
	  first included
	  header in all .c files and creds.h is never included by any
	  external tools

2006-07-20 00:28  ossman

	* : Add missing header.

2006-07-20 00:21  ossman

	* : Make -1 mean "current group/user" so that some platform

	  can be centralised.

2006-07-20 00:13  ossman

	  and a structure pa_creds
	  * rework credential authentication
	  * fix module-volume-restore and friends for usage in system-wide
	  instance
	  * remove loopback= argument from moulde-*-protocol-tcp since it
	  is a superset of listen= and usually a bad idea anyway since the
	  user shouldn't load the TCP module at all if he doesn't want
	  remote access
	  * rename a few variables in the jack modules to make sure they
	  don't conflict with symbols defined in the system headers
	  * add server address for system-wide daemons to the default
	  server list for the the client libs
	  * update todo

2006-07-19 18:14  lennart

	  * add PA_ prefixes to all global #defines
	  * modify auth-by-creds: define a new group "pulse-access" which
	  is used for authentication
	  * add proper privilige dropping when running in --system mode
	  * create runtime directory once on startup and not by each module
	  seperately

2006-07-18 19:53  lennart

	* : remove glib 1.2 adapter. It started to bitrot and wasn't used
	  by anything anyway.

2006-07-18 19:50  lennart

	* : add two more \since

2006-07-18 19:19  lennart

	* : fix module-detect on FreeBSD (patch from Diego "Flameeyes"
	  Pettenó)

2006-07-18 18:52  lennart

	* : turn the glib adapter into a single GSource instead of creating
	  a bunch of seperate GSources for each event

2006-07-18 18:51  lennart

	* : define proper typdefs for callback prototypes

2006-07-17 21:20  lennart

	* : change licensing blurb form "Library GPL" to "Lesser GPL" on
	  request of Loic Minier. Effectively this means using the same
	  license blurb like in all other source files.

2006-07-17 11:42  ossman

	* : Forgot to protect one access to with_creds with an ifdef.

2006-07-17 11:26  ossman

	* : Restore SIGPIPE warning when the platform doesn't have
	  MSG_NOSIGNAL.

	  "Flameeyes" Petteno)

2006-07-16 17:42  lennart

	* : todo

2006-07-16 17:38  lennart

	* : show summary after "configure" has run (closes: #22)

2006-07-16 17:29  lennart

	* : show value of PA_SINK_HARDWARE/PA_SOURCE_HARDWARE in pactl

2006-07-16 17:28  lennart

	* : set is_hardware flag for a few hw plugins

2006-07-16 17:28  lennart

	* : add new PA_SOURCE_HARDWARE/PA_SINK_HARDWARE flag

2006-07-16 17:26  lennart

	* : add a new boolean variable is_hardware to pa_sink/pa_source to
	  denote wether the specific device is a hardware device or

2006-07-14 23:59  lennart

2006-07-14 23:08  lennart

	* : update todo

2006-07-14 23:06  lennart

	* : remove checking for SIGPIPE blocking from client code. Because
	  we use
	  send(,,MSG_NOSIGNAL) for most socket writes now the reason for
	  SIGPIPE blocking
	  is no longer give. We keep this check for the server side
	  however, because
	  pipes create SIGPIPE too but cannot be used with MSG_NOSIGNAL.
	  Some modules use
	  pipes for internal and external communication.

2006-07-14 23:00  lennart

	* : don't send SCM_CREDENTIALS on every sendmsg(), instead do it
	  only on handshake

2006-07-14 23:00  lennart

	* : don't set MSG_NOSIGNAL for recvmsg(), since it doesn't make
	  sense there

2006-07-14 22:42  lennart

	* : try to use send(,,MSG_NOSIGNAL) instead of write() wherever
	  possible (which
	  will allow us to drop the SIGPIPE check). Cache the results of
	  the last
	  write()/send() to make sure that we do not issue more than
	  necessary system
	  calls.

2006-07-14 10:20  lennart

	* : remove vi'ism

2006-07-14 10:19  lennart

2006-07-14 00:19  lennart

	* : add new test get-binary-name-test for testing
	  pa_get_binary_name()

2006-07-14 00:18  lennart

	* : Don't call pa_path_get_filename() anymore since it is
	  implicitly called by pa_get_binary_name() anyway

2006-07-14 00:17  lennart

	* : * fall back to prctl(PR_GET_NAME) in pa_get_binary_name() if
	  readlink() fails
	  * call pa_path_get_filename() in all cases before returning in
	  pa_get_binary_name(). We already did so on Win32, but didn't on
	  Linux.

2006-07-13 23:12  lennart

	* : support time events with NULL timevals which are OK in avahi,
	  but not in PA. This makes padevchooser actually work on top of
	  the new avahi browsing stuff

2006-07-13 23:10  lennart

	* : update todo

2006-07-13 18:23  lennart

	  * add doxygen docs to browser.h

2006-07-13 15:54  lennart

	  API, instead of HOWL

	* : make sure gccmacro.h and cdecl.h may be included at the same
	  time as those headers from the avahi project

2006-07-13 15:51  lennart

	* : check for avahi in configure.ac

2006-07-10 17:56  lennart

	  output needlessly.

2006-06-20 14:26  ossman

	* : Make sure we do not use pthread_yield() on platforms that do
	  not have them.

2006-06-20 14:22  ossman

	  called when the pdispatch object is destroyed but the reply
	  hasn't yet been
	  recieved.
	  
	  * move prototype of pa_free_cb from stream.h to def.h

2006-04-24 15:07  ossman

	* : chown() and chmod() aren't available on Windows.

2006-04-24 13:59  ossman

	* : Undo invalid automake version requirement.

2006-04-23 21:25  lennart

	* : fix a segfault when uploading samples with esound

2006-04-23 21:01  lennart

	* : * add validity checking for sample_spec, channel_map and
	  cvolume structures
	  * return PA_ERR_TOOLARGE when the user tries to upload a
	  over-sized sample
	  * notify the user if uploading a simple faield due to some reason

2006-04-23 20:59  lennart

	* : small optimization

2006-04-23 20:59  lennart

	* : fix sample uploading

2006-04-23 20:59  lennart

	* : enforce maximum sample size in sample cache

2006-04-23 20:58  lennart

	* : * fix ref counting of pa_stream: strictly refcount from context
	  to stream and never vice versa to make sure that we never loose
	  memory
	  * don't hit an assert() in case of a timeout events

2006-04-23 20:56  lennart

	* : introduce a new error PA_ERR_TOOLARGE

2006-04-23 19:49  lennart

	* : * when playing back a sample from the sample cache, just take a
	  pa_volume_t and not a pa_cvolume_t as argument for the volume.
	  Usually it is not known to the player of theses samples how many
	  channels it has, hence it doesn't make any sense to allow him to
	  pass a by-channel volume structure here.
	  * fix volume calculation when playing samples from the sample
	  cache

2006-04-23 19:46  lennart

	* : fix multiplication of software pa_cvolumes

2006-04-23 19:42  lennart

	* : allow recieving of invalid channel maps, volumes and sample
	  specs. This makes handling of uninitialized data better, e.g.
	  when sending info about lazy-load sample chache entries, where
	  the channel mapping and sample spec is still unknown.

2006-04-23 14:29  lennart

	* : * Merge build system patch from Igor Zubkov

	* : require automake 1.9 in configure.ac

2006-04-22 21:51  lennart

	* : modify x11 modules to not cache the Display variable since
	  pa_x11wrap_get_display() is now used as notification that the x11
	  output buffer needs flushing

2006-04-22 21:50  lennart

	* : when loading sound files, initialize channel map data properly

2006-04-22 21:49  lennart

2006-04-22 21:04  lennart

	  shutdown
	  * other cleanups

2006-04-22 20:05  lennart

	* : add new function pa_parent_dir()

2006-04-22 20:04  lennart

2006-04-22 20:04  lennart

	* : try to remove the directory where the PID file resides in after
	  removing the PID file

2006-04-22 14:31  lennart

	* : chown() and chmod() /tmp/.esd/ before checking if everything is
	  ok with it

2006-04-20 12:53  lennart

	* : replace copy by symlink when installing homepage

2006-04-20 12:45  lennart

2006-04-20 12:33  lennart

	* : * rename "LICENSE" to "LGPL"
	  * add GPL text
	  * update LGPL text in regards to FSF addresses

2006-04-20 07:44  ossman

	* : update todo

2006-04-19 15:37  ossman

	* : Tweaks for the solaris module. The sound system requires
	  complete frames
	  to be written. Also, the sample counter can magically go
	  backwards sometimes,
	  causing havoc with our buffer handling.

2006-04-19 14:30  ossman

	* : Sun's documentation about SIGPOLL on EOF:s is wrong, so use a
	  timer based
	  solution instead.

2006-04-19 11:56  ossman

	* : Minor fixes for the way Windows handles sockets.

2006-04-19 11:55  ossman

	* : WaveOut needs to have rather large chunks. This is about as low
	  as we can
	  go without getting underflows.

2006-04-19 11:54  ossman

	* : Win32 needs to have the socket subsystem initialised.

2006-04-19 11:53  ossman

	* : Having constant deferred events isn't allowed and causes
	  problems. Use timers
	  instead.

2006-04-19 07:31  ossman

	* : Reverse order of IPv6/IPv4 binding to handle systems without
	  IPV6_V6ONLY.
	  
	  System that always do IPV6_V6ONLY will now still bind to both
	  sockets, just
	  in another order.
	  
	  System that never do IPV6_V6ONLY will now fail to bind IPv4
	  instead of IPv6.
	  But since they force IPv6 sockets to accept IPv4 connections,
	  everything is
	  peachy anyway.

2006-04-18 19:44  lennart

	* : make proper use of the muting facility of sinks in
	  module-mmkbd-evdev

2006-04-18 19:31  lennart

	* : Make the probe for RNG sources at runtime since the configure
	  script isn't
	  compatible with cross-compiling.

2006-04-16 10:53  lennart

	* : * make sure RTP ports are chosen to be even

2006-04-16 09:23  ossman

	* : Fix ALSA fd handling to be compatible with blocking deferred
	  events.

2006-04-16 09:22  ossman

2006-04-12 22:45  lennart

	* : * dispatch defer events in pa_mainloop_dispatch() and not
	  already in pa_mainloop_prepare()
	  * fix the "timeout" parameter of pa_mainloop_prepare()
	  * remove pa_mainloop_deferred_pending() and update the simple API
	  accordingly

2006-04-12 18:33  lennart

	* : * fix latency calculation where a full playback buffer was
	  erroneously taken as empty buffer and vice versa.

2006-04-12 17:26  lennart

	* : remove a bunch of log messages

2006-04-12 17:18  lennart

	* : beefup pacat a little:
	  * when -v is passed, show current playback time and latency
	  * modify SIGUSR1 behaviour to show only playback time and latency

2006-04-12 17:17  lennart

	* : * rename "latency correction" to "write index correction"
	  * add read index invalidation code
	  * rename "ipol_event" stuff to "auto_timing_update"
	  * remove buffer_usec field from pa_timing_info, since it can be

	  * add read_index_corrupt field to "pa_timing_info", similar to
	  the already existing write_index_corrupt field
	  * restart automatic timing update event every time a query is
	  issued, not just when the last event elapsed
	  * proper invalidation code for pa_stream_flush()
	  * do tarsnport/sink/source latency correction for playback time
	  only when device is not corked

2006-04-12 17:12  lennart

	* : protocol change: don't send stream buffer size in latency
	  update. This data is redundant, since it can be calculated from
	  write_index - read_index anyway

2006-04-12 17:10  lennart

	* : proper validity checking for pa_context_is_pending()

2006-04-12 17:09  lennart

2006-04-09 19:31  ossman

2006-04-08 00:19  lennart

	* : add proper volume clipping support for OSS devices

2006-04-08 00:09  lennart

	* : when doing software volume adjustments, don't use the volume
	  value as linear factor, but pass it through
	  pa_sw_volume_to_linear() first.

2006-04-07 23:08  lennart

	* : remove another item from the todo list

2006-04-07 23:05  lennart

	  * show volume for sources, too
	  * show value of "mute" field for sinks/sources

2006-04-07 23:02  lennart

	* : add new introspection data field for sinks/sources: a flags
	  field which specifies whether the sink/source supports hw volume
	  control and latency querying

2006-04-07 22:46  lennart

	* : todo update

2006-04-07 22:45  lennart

	* : minor cleanups

2006-04-07 22:28  lennart

2006-04-07 21:57  lennart

	* : todo update

2006-04-07 21:55  lennart

	  the data pointer instead.

2006-04-07 01:32  lennart

	* : remove yet another item from the todo list

2006-04-07 01:31  lennart

	* : hdie some more

2006-04-07 01:29  lennart

	* : * update docs for reworked latency API
	  * rename pa_latency_info to pa_timing_info, since that describes
	  better what it is. Most people will only use pa_stream_get_time()
	  anyway

2006-04-07 00:25  lennart

	* : update simple API for new latency API

2006-04-07 00:25  lennart

	* : update pacat.c for new latency API

2006-04-07 00:24  lennart

2006-04-06 23:52  lennart

	  * other cleanups

2006-04-06 23:31  lennart

	* : change pa_gettimeofday() to return a pointer to the struct
	  timeval*, instead of an int

2006-04-06 23:28  lennart

	* : s/index/idx/, to avoid gcc warning

2006-04-06 23:28  lennart

	* : * set IPV6_V6ONLY for IPv6 sockets, to avoid warning when both
	  ipv6 and the ipv4 sockets try to bind to the same port
	  * enable SO_REUSEADDR only on platforms that support it

2006-04-06 20:17  lennart

	* : remove some GCC warnings introduced by improperly casting to

	* : Fix some warnings caused by size_t having varying size.

2006-03-31 08:34  ossman

	* : Large file support. Polypaudio probably doesn't need it, but it
	  causes warnings
	  when linking libpolyp with applications that do. So this is just
	  to make life
	  easier for other applications.

2006-03-17 08:16  ossman

	* : update todo

2006-03-11 21:26  ossman

2006-03-11 21:25  ossman

	* : Remember to store the struct with module info.

2006-03-08 13:00  ossman

	* : We filled the volume with the wrong channel count (we used the
	  input, not
	  the output) causing static. Also swapped the comments since they
	  were
	  misplaced.

2006-03-07 18:29  ossman

	* : The extra stream ref actually did some good. Re-add it, but
	  with some more
	  symmetry, assertions and comments.

2006-03-07 16:04  ossman

	* : We've already set an initial reference count of 1 so don't
	  count it up again.

2006-03-07 16:02  ossman

	* : Trying to listen on an IPv6 socket by default and only do IPv4
	  if that fails
	  (which it doesn't most of the time) is terribly confusing. What
	  the user
	  most likely wants is for it to listen to both IPv4 and IPv6 and
	  gracefully
	  continue if only of them succeed.

2006-03-05 21:00  ossman

	  10) create typedefs for a bunch of API callback prototypes
	  11) simplify handling of HUP poll() events
	  
	  Yes, i know, it's usually better to commit a lot of small patches
	  instead of a
	  single big one. In this case however, this would have
	  contradicted the other
	  rule: never commit broken or incomplete stuff.
	  
	  *** This stuff needs a lot of additional testing! ***

2006-02-18 14:58  lennart

	* : update todo

2006-02-17 17:00  ossman

	* : That's a delta parameter, not a size parameter.

2006-02-17 15:42  ossman

	* : Have a memblock queue on the client side during recording. This
	  makes the
	  record callback optional in stead of mandatory.
	  
	  For applications that wish to retain the old behaviour, simply
	  call
	  pa_stream_peek() followed by pa_stream_drop() in the callback.

2006-02-17 13:20  ossman

	* : Ignore generated win32 binaries.

2006-02-17 12:34  ossman

	* : Make sure that all polypcore headers are installed.

2006-02-17 12:10  ossman

2006-02-17 09:12  ossman

	* : Move the util libs to the modules section since they're in that

	  compilation with emacs easier
	  
	  they are not intended to be distributed or anything.

2006-02-16 22:08  lennart

	* : move alsa-util.[ch], oss-util.[ch] and howl-wrap.[ch] to the
	  modules directory since they are just helper source used
	  exclusively by the modules

2006-02-16 21:37  lennart

	* : * svn:ignore some files
	  * move configuration files to the directories they belong to
	  * built esd-compat.sh in the src/ dir

2006-02-16 19:19  ossman

	  subdirs:
	  
	  * daemon/ - Contains the files specific to the polypaudio daemon.
	  * modules/ - All loadable modules.
	  * polyp/ - Files that are part of the public, application
	  interface or

	  not a pa_volume_t
	  scalar.

2006-02-13 13:37  ossman

	* : Add function to "wake up", i.e. interrupt, a running poll().
	  This is needed
	  when having the poll() in a separate thread.

2006-02-13 13:28  ossman

	* : Split mainloop_iterate() into three, distinct parts. Allows for
	  more flexible

2006-02-03 13:33  ossman

	* : Use defines and not hard coded values for volume levels. Caused
	  incorrect
	  volume levels for all esound clients that changed the volume.

2006-02-03 12:23  ossman

	* : Volume adjustment must be done _after_ dropping the chunk since
	  drop will
	  reject a modified chunk.

2006-02-03 09:14  ossman

	* : Reverting an incorrect checkin.

2006-01-30 12:58  ossman

	  implements this for now)
	  * fix a lot of types for _t suffix

2006-01-27 14:52  ossman

	* : Remove the version number from the module directory. Makes life
	  easier
	  for any external projects that need to use that directory.

2006-01-25 17:27  ossman

	* : We get the -lcap through LIBS, so no need for CAP_LIBS.

2006-01-25 17:25  ossman

	* : Use AC_SEARCH_LIBS instead of AC_CHECK_LIBS since it is a lot
	  smarter and
	  doesn't add unnecessary libs.

2006-01-20 10:16  ossman

	* : Fix so that peer name can be determined on Windows. We do not
	  support console
	  on Windows at this time so we do not have to worry about that
	  right now.

2006-01-19 10:26  ossman

	* : Open the device in non-blocking mode.

2006-01-19 10:24  ossman

	* : Ugly hack to get around Solaris particularly brain dead sound
	  system.
	  The system has a buffer size of 0.5 MB which cannot be changed.
	  We emulate
	  a smaller buffer through some SIGPOLL trickery.

2006-01-16 13:35  ossman

	* : We need a logical, not an arithmetic shift here. So use
	  unsigned types when
	  doing the shifting.

2006-01-12 17:12  ossman

	* : Under win32 we freed the wrong pointer causing a segmentation
	  fault.

2006-01-12 16:11  ossman

	* : Some crappy hardware generate noise on the output when reading
	  input. To
	  avoid triggering this needlesly we tweak the algorithm a bit to
	  avoid reading
	  when nothing is connected to the source.

2006-01-12 16:09  ossman

	* : Some drivers (via82xx) doesn't start recording until we read
